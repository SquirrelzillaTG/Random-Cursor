An Application that largely runs in the back ground that on click randomizes the cursor.

You can select which cursors can or can't be randomized.
Each cursor scheme is married to an ID number.
That ID number is selected when the random function is called on each and every time a user clicks a thing. 
The even trigger to cause this is when the mouse is depressed.
